## REST Service

Hey there, thanks for coming! If you got here is because you are looking for something to help implementing the HTTP requests for your app, right? 
That's exactly what this framework does and I hope it fits in your project smoothly. You might be wondering why another service and what are the advantages over great frameworks like Alamofire, right?
Well, indeed there are many solutions out there and they are great for sure. The only think is that they are so good that they have too much possibilities and I wanted to build something really simple, secure and easy to use.
Let me show you how it works and you will decide if it's a good solution for you.

## Setup

#### CocoaPods

If you are using CocoaPods, add this to your Podfile and run `pod install`.

```Ruby
target 'Your target name' do
    pod 'RestService', '~> 1.0'
end
```

#### Manual Installation

If you want to add it manually to your project, without a package manager, just copy all files from the `Classes` folder to your project.

## Usage

#### Creating the Service

To create an instance of the service, you only need to import the framework and instantiate the `RestService` with your host. Let's say that your host is `https://server.com/`:

```swift
import RestService
let service = RestService(host: "server.com")
```

It will create a service ready to be used with an `https` scheme. But let's say you need to use something else, you can add more information for the service:

```swift
import RestService
let service = RestService(session: URLSession.shared, scheme: .http, host: "localhost", port: 3000)
```

With that, it will create a service for `http://localhost:3000/`.

#### Making a simple request

Now that you have you service crated, it's time to make some requests. Let's start with a very simple `GET` request on the `api/users` endpoint:

```swift
service.json(
	method: .get,
	path: "/api/users",
	interceptor: nil) { response in
		print(response.stringValue())
}
```

See that? It is very simple!

#### Making a request with parameters

Now let's make some request with parameters, but first let's clarify something about these parameters. When you make `GET`, `HEAD` and `DELETE` requests, you send parameters as query strings, but for all other methods, you send parameters in the request body. With that, the `RestService` will set the right properties depending on the method you have selected for that request.

Another thing here is to decide if you want to use simple dictionaries or `Encodable` objects as the parameters. I personally prefer `Encodable` objects, because the compiler will complain about a typo in your parameter names, for instance, and it will be better to code the API logic.

So, let's make a `GET` request with some parameters:

```swift
let parameters: [String: Any] = [
	"username": "john", 
	"limit": 10, 
	"offset": 0
]

service.json(
	method: .get,
	path: "/api/users",
	parameters: parameters,
	interceptor: nil) { response in
		print(response.stringValue())
}
```

What just happened? Well, it did create a request for this URL without a body: `https://server.com/api/users?username=john&limit=10&offset=0`

What about `POST` requests? Let's see!

```swift
struct CreateUserRequest: Codable {
	let username: String
	let password: String
}

let parameters = CreateUserRequest(username: "john", password: "safepassword")

service.json(
	method: .post,
	path: "/api/users",
	parameters: parameters,
	interceptor: nil) { response in
		print(response.stringValue())
}
```

With that, it has created a `POST` request for `https://server.com/api/users` with this `JSON` body:

```json
{
	"username": "john",
	"password": "safepassword"
}
```

Cool, right?

#### Making requests with an interceptor

Interceptors are a great way to change something on a request just before sending it to the server. That's a really good opportunity to add some headers like an authentication token, for instance. Let's see it in action!

```swift
struct TokenInterceptor: RestRequestInterceptor {
	func adapt(request: URLRequest) -> URLRequest {
		var request = request
		request.addValue("Bearer gahsjdGJSgdsajagA", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
		return request
	}
}

let interceptor = TokenInterceptor()

service.json(
	method: .get,
	path: "/api/me",
	interceptor: interceptor) { response in
		print(response.stringValue())
}
```

This will add that token to the request just before the execution. Interceptors can be reused and they are great to add all those required stuff by the server.

### Dealing with the response from the server

One of the things that many people have issues is with the reponse from the server. Casting values, serializing, decoding... the possibilities are unlimited. What I tried to achieve with this framework was to have a nice response object that could provide us everything we want during the development (debugging) and release.

The result is the `RestResponse` object. It has only the 3 properties `URLResponse` gives, the the original `URLRequest` and some nice computed properties and methods to handle the data.

#### Status Code

You can easily see the status code of the response with this computed property. It will return `-1` if there was some error in the response.

```swift
service.json(
	method: .get,
	path: "/api/me",
	interceptor: interceptor) { response in
		if 200..<300 ~= response.statusCode {
			print("cool!")
		} else {
			print("oops!")
		}
}
```

#### Headers

If you need to get some information from the response's headers, you can easily get it by acessing the property:

```swift
service.json(
	method: .get,
	path: "/api/me",
	interceptor: interceptor) { response in
		print(response.headers["Token"])
}
```

#### String Value

When you receive a response from the server, it comes with a `Data?` body. If you want to convert it to a string value, just need to use the method and optionally giving a string encoder:

```swift
service.json(
	method: .get,
	path: "/api/me",
	interceptor: interceptor) { response in
		print(response.stringValue())
		print(response.stringValue(encoding: .Latin1))
}
```

#### Int Value

Some responses comes with a simple integer value, so you can easily get it:

```swift
service.json(
	method: .get,
	path: "/api/users/count",
	interceptor: interceptor) { response in
		print(response.intValue())
}
```

#### Double Value

You might also want to get a double value from the response:

```swift
service.json(
	method: .get,
	path: "/api/fees/default",
	interceptor: interceptor) { response in
		print(response.doubleValue())
}
```

#### Dictionary Value

If you want to get a dictionary from the response, there is a method for that:

```swift
service.json(
	method: .get,
	path: "/api/me",
	interceptor: interceptor) { response in
		let dictionary = response.dictionaryValue()
		print(dictionary?["name"])
}
```

#### Array Value

You might also want to get an array from the response, so you can use this:

```swift
service.json(
	method: .get,
	path: "/api/users",
	interceptor: interceptor) { response in
		let list = response.arrayValue()
		print(list?.first)
}
```

#### Decodable Value

Now here comes the real good thing. You can try to convert the response to any kind of `Decodable` objects. That will make your life easier in many ways. Let's say that your server can give a response with an object, a list of objects or an error object, all in the response body:

```swift
service.json(
	method: .get,
	path: "/api/users",
	interceptor: interceptor) { response in
		if let user = response.decodableValue(of: User.self) {
			showSingle(user: user)
		} else if let users = response.decodableValue(of: [User].self) {
			showList(of: users)
		} else if let error = response.decodableValue(of APIError.self) {
			showAn(error: error)
		}
}
```

## RestPath

There is also a special object called `RestPath`. As you can see, it is very simple:

```Swift
struct RestPath: RawRepresentable, Equatable, Hashable {
	typealias RawValue = String
	let rawValue: String
	init(rawValue: String) {
		self.rawValue = rawValue
	}
}
```

The reason for creating that object is that you can send a list of `RestPath` instances to build a type-safe path. Let's say you want to make a request to get a specific user:

```Swift
extension RestPath {
	static let api = RestPath(rawValue: "api")
	static let users = RestPath(rawValue: "users")
}

let userIdPath = RestPath(rawValue: "1")

service.json(
	method: .get,
	path: [.api, .users, .userIdPath],
	interceptor: interceptor) { response in
		print(response.stringValue())
}
```

The resulting URL will be: `http://server.com/api/users/1`.

This is how we can safely reuse rest paths throughout the app and it is even better in local frameworks because you can create internal extensions for each one.
